/**
 * 
 * Create a program that asks the user to enter a command.
 * 
 * If they hit the return key without entering anything,
 * ask them again to enter a command.
 * 
 * If they enter 'start' or 'START', regardless of capitalisation,
 * print 'Machine starting ....'
 * 
 * If they enter 'stop', regardless of capitalisation, print
 * 'Machine stopping ....'.
 * 
 * If they enter 'quit', print 'Exiting ....' and quit the program.
 * 
 * Otherwise print 'Unrecognised command'.
 * 
 * Ask them to enter a command repeatedly until they stop the program
 * by entering 'quit'.
 * 
 * Ignore whitespace at the start and end of the command
 * 
 * Hints:
 * 
 * Use a 'switch' nested in an 'if'.
 * 
 * Use the string length to determine if they have entered nothing.
 * 
 * Use trim() to ignore whitespace.
